FBA Solution Pack to handle autocomplete callbacks.

Entries in the solr schema (/usr/local/fedora/gsearch_solr/solr/conf/schema.xml)
for mads.authorityCI and fbastring_ci are used to make case insensitive copies
of preferred terms available in the index.

In the "Autocomplete Path", use:
    http://<ip address or servername>/autocomplete/<custom callback value>


So far, the following custom callback values are supported:

Name                "vocab"
Function called     _get_matching_vocab_terms($collection, $typedterm)
Application         For the Library article/chapter/monograph forms, used on the "Subject Keywords" field.
Autocomplete Path   http://<ip address or servername>/autocomplete/vocab
Returns             10 preferred terms starting with the characters typed by user (case insensitive)
